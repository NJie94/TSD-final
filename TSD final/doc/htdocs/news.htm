      <p>A new version of ccdoc: v08r39, is available with the following changes:</p>

        <li>Converted all of the source files to unix format for the upcoming

        <li>Converted all of the source files to unix format for the upcoming 
          release to cygwin (ccdoc-0.8.39-1).</li>
        <li>Created a cygwin compatible release package (with lots of help from 
          the cygwin folks). The package provides a man page, a configure script, 
          patches, etc. This might be useful for folks that want to support ccdoc 
          on linux platforms. I will add a link to the cygwin package when it 
          is officially accepted.</li>
        <li>Improved the man page generation (also for cygwin). There were still 
          a number of problems in r38. The r39 man page is now readable.</li>
        <li>Removed dead code found by Christian Ehrlicher during his port to 
          the Borland compiler.</li>
        <li>Issue <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0152">0152</a> - Ignore duplicate 
          macros names. <i>This surfaced during r39 testing. I found a case where 
          duplicate macros were reported when they were defined in different packages.</i></li>
        <li>Issue <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0167">0167</a> - In German we 
          want to use embedded dots in the short description.</li>
        <li>Issue <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0168">0168</a> - Slow g++ 3.2 
          compile of help.cc because of the large help string.</li>

      The Mac OSX port is not yet available because the server on the SourceForge 
      compile farm server that I use for porting is down. I will update the release

      <p>Updated the counter script to allow users to add keys by id. This allows 
        multiple users to share the same counter file. I also added a bunch of 
        examples that show how to use the script in the help.</p>
      <p>Uploaded all of the ccdoc source to the sourceforge.net CVS repository 
        and added the sourceforge log to this page per their request.</p>
      <p>I still need to figure out how to organize the release to make it source 
        forge like but for now you should be able to get everything that you need.

      <p>I have been completely lame about updating my web pages and have received 
        a lot of mail from folks asking whether ccdoc is still being supported. 
        The answer yes, here is what I have been doing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Planning for the next release (r27).</li>
        <li>Fixing some bugs.</li>
        <li>Working on XML output.</li>
        <li>Looking at whether doxygen can replace ccdoc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The last bullet probably requires some explanation. </p>
      <p>A number of folks have suggested that ccdoc be combined with doxygen 
        (a very good source code documentation and browsing system). Since I really 
        didn't know much about doxygen I looked into it. My conclusion is that 
        doxygen is much more that ccdoc will ever be. </p>
      <p>The development team has done a great job of developing a tool that documents 
        and provides source code browsing for C++ projects and I strongly recommend 
        it. </p>
      <p>Ccdoc is only meant to document interfaces so there is no question that 
        doxygen is a superset of ccdoc from a functional perspective. </p>
      <p>From a project standpoint, I am still trying to understand what ccdoc 
        users want. A few of them have reported that they really like the interface 
        only approach and some users even use both tools. I am still polling and 
        have currently decided to continue to support ccdoc to the best of my 
        ability.</p>
      <p>Please let me know what you think. Here are the choices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Continue to support ccdoc as an interface documentation tool.</li>
        <li>Cease work on ccdoc and work with the doxygen team to get ccdoc like 
          output.</li>

      <p>In addition, a new feature has been added (as described by <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0086">0086</a>). 
        This feature was requested and implemented by Ben Zoe. It allows you to 
        specify a C++ style, single line, suffix comments as shown in the example 
        below:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre align="right">class Point3D {
public:
  int p1; //@- The x coordinate.
  int p2; //@- The y coordinate.
  int p3; //@- The z coordinate.
};</pre>

          to @throws per javadoc 1.2.</li>
        <li><a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0085">0085</a> - Ccdoc not recognize

        <li><a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0087">0087</a> - Exceptions were not 
          reported as links.</li>
        <li><a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0088">0088</a> - An extra invalid 
          link reported for @link references to classes.</li>

          syntax is not compliant with javadoc.</li>
        <li><a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0090">0090</a> - Support the {@link 
          ...} javadoc syntax.</li>

      <p><b>Note</b> that the fix for issue <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0082">0082</a> 
        will change the database contents so you will have to re-generate your 
        databases. This is because the comment schema was modified to accomodate 
        the new @since directive. I consider this intrusion acceptable because 
        all clients that I know of re-generate the databases each time they run.</p>
      <p><b>Note </b>that the fix for issue <a href="issues/issues.html#TAG_0089">0089</a> 
        will change your HTML output because the javadoc syntax for short descriptions 
        is different than the old ccdoc syntax. You can use the old ccdoc style 
        syntax by specifying the -nojdsd switch. I decided to make the javadoc 
        syntax the default because the behavior ccdoc input syntax is supposed 
        to conform as closely as possible to javadoc semantics. The users guide 
        has been updated to reflect this behavior.</p>
      <p><b>Note</b> that the users guide has been updated to reflect the new 
        @since, @throws and {@link...} support.</p>

      <p>I have fixed the problem and have released the updated version of ccdoc.</p>
      <p>To determine whether you have a broken version specify -rptmac on the 
        command line. If you get an error about a missing file, you have the old 
        version. You can workaround this problem by specifying -macros or -no 
        macros or you can fix the problem by downloading the most recent version 
        of the release.</p>
